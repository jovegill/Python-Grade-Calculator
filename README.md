# Python-Grade-Calculator
In this project I created a GUI using PySimpleGUI in Python. This grade calcluator allows you to input your grades (separated by commas) and then press the 'Calculate' button on the GUI to compute your average grade from the grades you inputted. A possible future improvement would be allowing grades to have a weight depending on the amount of credits a course has.
